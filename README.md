d3v4 Timeline

I built this timeline to display my work history which has been an overlapping mess making my resume dates look practically incomprehensible.

Check out these other great d3 timelines. Neither of these fit my immediate needs hopefully one of these three will suit yours. Happy coding! ðŸ˜†
